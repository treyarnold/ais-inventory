# AIS Inventory

> Bar Inventory system.  This app will have a database with multiple tables (Users, Current Inventory, Drinks, Usage) with the focus being to easily and quickly complete an inventory.  Also, we will have manager and POS views.  When a drink is entered its liqour contents will be decreased from inventory.  We will be creating a mobile view as well that uses a UPC scanner with the camera to scan inventory in.
